Spring is also the combination of multiple projects is not just one project which I'll be using.
we have a support module for it if you want to work on web if you want to make a application.

We have a separate module for it and of course one of our favorite.

If you want to build REST application We have separate module .

What if I say it's spring also can be used for security.

If you want to Connect with database with the help of some JPA spring has a different module so spring is

basically a collection of modules it has right and then will be going through most of this model.


// maven dependency

We can create a java project but there is one issue with this the issue is when you work with spring framework.

We need to add a spring dependencies.

Right.

And when you say you want to add spring dependencies you have to go to Google.

You have to search for all the dependencies which we need.

And then you have to download it manually.

But what if I say you can do that with the help of maven because MAVEN will help you here.

So maven is basically a build tool which will help you to get dependencies which will help you create

a package for your project which will help you to compile your codes as well.
